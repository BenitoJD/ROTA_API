ROTA_API is a backend web service built in C# (ASP.NET / .NET Core) that powers the ROTA system ‚Äî exposing endpoints for rota / shift scheduling, employee management, and resource allocation.

It decouples the business logic and data layer from frontends (web UI, mobile, or other clients), providing a clean, maintainable, and scalable API surface.

üéØ Purpose & Value

Provides a centralized API layer to serve different clients (UI, dashboards)

Encapsulates all domain logic around shift assignment, availability, and conflict resolution

Lets frontend(s) focus solely on presentation & interaction

Enables future extensions (microservices, integrations with other systems like HR, payroll)

üß± Architecture Overview & Components

Controllers / Endpoints: define resources (e.g. /employees, /shifts, /assignments, /rotas)

Services / Business Logic Layer: rules for validating assignments, conflicts, consistency

Data Layer / Persistence: entities / models + data access (ORM, repository, etc.)

DTOs / Models: for input / output contracts

Middleware / Pipeline: logging, error handling, authentication / authorization

Configuration / Dependency Injection: wiring up services, repositories, etc.

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack (hypothesized)

Framework: ASP.NET Core Web API

Language: C#

Data Storage: SQL (e.g. SQL Server, PostgreSQL) or any relational DB via Entity Framework or similar

Serialization / API Format: JSON over HTTP

Security: JWT / token-based auth, role-based access control

Testing: Unit / integration tests over service layer and controller endpoints

üí° Key Features (expected / desirable)

CRUD endpoints for core domain entities (employees, shifts, assignments, rota schedules)

Business rules enforcement: no overlapping shifts, respecting availability, minimum rest periods

Query endpoints: fetch rota for a period, view assignments by employee or shift

Filtering, pagination, sorting for list endpoints

Error handling with meaningful messages

Versioned API / backward compatibility for clients

üöÄ Vision & Growth

Over time, ROTA_API can evolve into an enterprise-grade scheduling microservice that supports:

Multi-tenant deployments

Analytics & reporting APIs (e.g. utilization, shift coverage stats)

Hooks / webhooks for external systems (e.g. notifying payroll, HR, message queue)

Real-time features (e.g. push notifications, live updates)

Support for more complex constraints, optimization algorithms (e.g. balancing, fairness)
